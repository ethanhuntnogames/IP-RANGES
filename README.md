All IP ranges listed are based only on Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs).
They're pulled from routing data, not tied to domains or corporations.
If you’re looking for a full country pack — including hidden hosts, trackers, and CDN masks — you’ll need to do deeper research on your own. This isn’t the whole map.
Just the edge of it.
