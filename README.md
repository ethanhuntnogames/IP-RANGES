🌐 Important Notice About Country IP Range Lists
All the IP ranges linked below are based only on Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) assigned to networks within each country.

These ranges represent routing-level ownership, not specific companies or domain names.

The source is BGP routing data, as listed on bgp.he.net.

⚠️ These lists do not include all IPs used by companies or services based in the country, especially if:

The company hosts in another country (e.g., cloud/CDN like AWS, Akamai, etc.)

The domain uses IPs from international ASNs

The ASN is registered in a different jurisdiction
